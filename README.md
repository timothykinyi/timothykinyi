# 👋 Hey, I’m Timothy (Kinyi)

Full-Stack Developer | Technical Founder | Cloud & Security Enthusiast  

I am the Co-Founder & CEO of Bazelink, where I led development across both frontend and backend systems — architecting and building scalable, production-ready platforms from the ground up.

I specialize in designing complete digital ecosystems — from system architecture and API design to cloud deployment and performance optimization. With a strong foundation in networking, cybersecurity, and cloud computing, I build secure, scalable, and business-driven solutions.
